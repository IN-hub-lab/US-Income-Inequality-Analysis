# US Income Inequality Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis for exploring income inequality trends across the United States. We use unsupervised machine learning techniques such as KMeans clustering and dimensionality reduction to uncover regional income disparities based on demographic and employment indicators.

## Data Source

The dataset used comes from the US Census Bureau and is publicly available at:
https://data.census.gov/table?q=household+income

## Project Goals

- Analyze state-wise income inequality metrics
- Apply unsupervised clustering to group similar income distributions
- Visualize trends using Seaborn and Plotly
- Interpret regional patterns in income distribution

## Software Used

- Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/try
- Plotly Express: https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express
- Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
